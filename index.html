  					<h1> Hi, I'm Anthony Scimone,<small></small></h1>
<!--   					<h3>A self taught full stack developer and software engineer actively looking for employment</h3> -->
				</div>
				<p class="indent"> a software engineer and bio-technology enthusiast looking for a new position in Colorado. I studied Biological Engineering
				at Mizzou (University of Missouri-Columbia) and worked for several years as an aerospace engineer before
				moving to Colorado. In my free time I enjoy learning new computer science technologies, backpacking through the wilderness, reading, and rock climbing.
				<p>Please take a look at my Github to see some examples of my work and my linkedin page for more on my professional hisotry</p>


		<!-- 		From an early age, I had an interest in helping 
				I pursued a bachelors 

				In 2012, I graduated from college with a bachelors in Biomedical Engineering.
				After graduation, I took a position at lab doing analysis
				of biological reactors and discovered that I had no place in a laboratory. Soon after, I
				made my way into the aerospace engineering field to hone my skills as an engineer. That's
				when I discovered that I loved programming and computer science. After several years of
				playing with C++ to control my arduino board, I decided to pursue programming and computer
				science at a professional level. Since then I have taken an online bootcamp on full stack
				web development where I leared to make websites and web applications using NodeJS and Express. -->
				
<!-- 
				Hi, I’m Anthony Scimone, and I want to help save the world.
Curing cancer, stopping wars, and saving species are just a few of the things that get me up in the morning. Easier said than done, right? Minds much more brilliant than mine have been hard at work on this problems for longer than I’ve been alive. So how exactly does someone like me help save the world? Well, that’s easy. By doing what humans are best at: making tools. That’s why I’ve dedicated myself to programming and computer science. Most of the problems that humanity faces today are too big for us to handle. If we are ever going to solve these problems, we need technologies that can help us, and that’s what I’m here to help make. Technologies that future generations can use to solve problems the world over. -->
